It&#x27;s a seemingly innocuous one, but one that &#x27;plagues&#x27; the profession at all levels. Ironically, it&#x27;s not an issue that&#x27;s unique to developers, however it is one that we seem to have elevated complaints there-of to truly world class levels. Now, Im&#x27; not saying we&#x27;d win if there were ever a &quot;victim olympics&quot; for this complaint, but I&#x27;m also fairly confident of a podium finish.</p><p>&quot;Whatever could this most insipid, evil of plights be?&quot; you might ask.</p><p>Focus. There just isn&#x27;t enough time to focus and get any meaningful work done, and the time that is there is plagued by distractions, interruptions and the dreaded slew of meetings, we&#x27;re we&#x27;ll talk about the work we&#x27;ll do in the focus time that just does not exist.</p><p>We yearn for focus time. It&#x27;s our drug. It&#x27;s the reason we get up in the morning (tied with caffeine), the center of our universe. It is the Alpha, it  is the Omega baby. We abhor the idea of flitting from one thought to another and being &quot;busy&quot; yet ineffective.</p><p>That may be a bit of an over-exaggerated, all-encompassing generalisation, but you get the point. We tend value focus dearly, and can be pretty resentful of the things that take it away from us. What is flow, you may ask? Well, other than great, it&#x27;s pretty well defined in <a href="https://medium.com/better-advice/work-in-a-flow-state-for-2-hours-per-day-using-the-3c-method-3ffab28ee9e1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the following article</a>. Now, don&#x27;t think this is the only place / way we might find that flow occurs, however there are some handy points in there on what it is and things we can do to get there (though it&#x27;s not exhaustive).</p><p>TL;DR - Flow = awesome, long live flow.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-is-the-mob"></a>What is &quot;The Mob&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#what-is-the-mob" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><img alt="The Mob" src="/assets/images/MontyMobbingGroup01-6465324de3cd73aef7b535b3343cf989.jpeg"></p><p>So, on to the topic at hand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mobbing</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Mob programming (informally mobbing) (aka. ensemble programming) is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer or solution.</p></blockquote><p>That little extract above encapulates at a very, very high level what the definition of mobbing is, however it doesn&#x27;t really tell you what it <em>is</em>, if you catch my meaning. I think think quote much better captures what it truly <em>is</em></p><blockquote><p>&quot;For an idea to go from someone&#x27;s head into the computer, it must go through someone else&#x27;s hands&quot; - Llewellyn Falco </p></blockquote><p>###Focusing together</p><p>&quot;But wait, how did we get here. We started off talking about focus, and now we&#x27;re trying to solve for focus by putting people together? That sounds like a terrible idea!&quot; I hear from the back. An astute observation good sir / madam, and one I&#x27;ll poorly answer for the rest of this post, don&#x27;t you worry.</p><p>You see, this isn&#x27;t a binary world where one lives and one dies, but I do think that mobbing solves a lot of the problems that prevent focus time. Having one can augment the other, and vice versa. Let&#x27;s follow my tenuous train of thought for a moment.</p><p>One of the main reasons there are sustained interruptions / meetings / queries is to create a space for gaining clarity and updates. Far too many of the meetings we have is based on getting everyone around a table to talk about the work we&#x27;re going to do, and while this is without a doubt an essential conversation to have, and one that we tend to have all the time, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a conversation we&#x27;re very good at. Too often old ground is re-trod, and existing decisions are re-verified. What happens in mobbing, is all of the people responsible for doing the things agreed upon are sitting in the same space actual  ly doing something instead of talking about doing it. The next time we&#x27;re in that session? Progress has been made, there&#x27;s no reason for us to be re-treading old ground, we&#x27;ve moved past where we were and have new things to do (and not just talk about).</p><p>You see, the pace of our meetings and the pace of our doing should be aligned as much as possible, else we&#x27;re not having effective meetings, and here&#x27;s the cheat code. You can treat a mob session as allocated &quot;meeting&quot; time. Block it out, it&#x27;s a working meeting, you&#x27;re either gaining experience and learning or providing that for members of your team, and NOT sitting talking about work. It isn&#x27;t a catch-all, but there&#x27;s a marked improvement that you&#x27;ll be able to track.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="defining-your-problem-together-in-real-time"></a>Defining your problem together in real time.<a class="hash-link" href="#defining-your-problem-together-in-real-time" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><img alt="Don&amp;#39;t go alone" src="/assets/images/MontyMobbingRabbit01-02aa75dd1c640937931faca72e74689b.jpeg"></p><p>One of the greatest pros of this approach is the that of perspective. When we&#x27;re presented with a problem to be solved, our solutions to that problem will always be hamstrung by our own understanding of it. What is a UI issue to one is a workflow issue to another, which is data management to someone else still. We can try to alleviate this with planning sessions and quick questions here and there, but the reality is that problems that require solving aren&#x27;t all known during planning, and aren&#x27;t subject to a team-members availability. </p><p>Having 5 different perspectives around challenges as they arise gives us 5 different ways of getting to the core of the problem we&#x27;re actually trying to solve. We haven&#x27;t even begun to define the solution, and we&#x27;ve already cut waste by cutting down the possibility we&#x27;re solving for the wrong thing. </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="learning-all-the-things"></a>Learning all the things<a class="hash-link" href="#learning-all-the-things" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><img alt="Sceptical watching" src="/assets/images/MontyMobbingGroup02-5952934c4f8de565844973173f67dbcb.jpeg"></p><p>On an entirely selfish level, there is an incredible amount you can learn as a participant. There are the obvious sharing of technical knowledge and discovery, which is par for the course in the role, but the non-technical learnings are astounding. Some of my favourite things to learn from others in this setup are:</p><ul><li><strong>Process</strong> - it&#x27;s fascinating to see how different people go about approaching problems. You may find there are approaches that add a great deal </li><li><strong>Thinking</strong> - Logical leaps and intuitive routes of questioning. Thinking publicly, and being around people publicly thinking is both really insightful as well as stimulating. It&#x27;s intimidating to be vulnerable enough to be wrong, but everyone will be wrong at some point, and once you&#x27;ve seen that wizard of a developer who can do no wrong... well, this is awkward. Wait, they&#x27;re human too? Who&#x27;d have thought! </li><li><strong>Solving</strong> - There is a tangible excitement to a solution taking shape before your very eyes. Like a proud co-hort of parents, your solutions are joint-owned, joint-delivered, and everyone around the table will be able to come back to and work on that solution without too much help (and you know who to reach out to if you need to, they&#x27;re all around the (possibly virtual) table with you)</li><li><strong>How you think</strong> - this is my favourite. How you think, and how you portray your thoughts, will become better by virtue of the fact you&#x27;re doing it deliberately, with help and under friendly scrutiny. The suggestions / points of reference you and others in your team default to become those of the team, and we all become better off for it. There is no right or wrong way to approach things, but having more options in the arsenal, and becoming more efficient in our use of them, inherently makes us more effective in our problem solving (which is 90% of our job descriptions, but that&#x27;s a topic for another day I think)</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="this-is-a-great-idea-but-sounds-like-a-waste-of-capacity"></a>This is a great idea, but sounds like a waste of capacity<a class="hash-link" href="#this-is-a-great-idea-but-sounds-like-a-waste-of-capacity" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>I agreed with you. At first, it does sound like a waste of capacity. 5 people around 1 machine? That surely cannot beat 5 people at 5 machines. Well, get ready for assumptions to be tested my friend, as the reality will probably surprise you.</p><p><img alt="The Challenge" src="/assets/images/MontyMobbingKnight01-1d1559a8d64f785ce6e6164328216232.jpeg"></p><p>You see, having 5 peoples focus on the task at hand results in a break-down of silos, a concentration of context, and a much larger throughput pipe on that one machine than 5 machines in isolation. The reason for this is an uncomfortable one: </p><blockquote><p>The machines don&#x27;t do the work, people do, and we work better together.</p></blockquote><p>With shared context and focus, we&#x27;re better at: </p><ul><li>Getting more done</li><li>Working on meaningful things (we don&#x27;t like to waste our or one another&#x27;s time)</li><li>The quality of the work is better as we&#x27;re both checking and being checked in real time</li><li>RAPID feedback</li><li>We&#x27;re continuously reviewing our code and design</li></ul><p>That, and it&#x27;s more fun. Trust me. </p><p><img alt="The Results" src="/assets/images/MontyMobbingKnight02-7074207ba85da9a2323d07f3cb04982c.jpeg"></p><p>I&#x27;m now shamelessly stealing quotes from the &quot;Mob programming and the power of flow&quot; video (linked at the end of the article), but this is a great one: </p><blockquote><p>&quot;A system is not the sum of the behaviour of its parts, it&#x27;s the product of their interactions.&quot; - Russel Ackoff </p></blockquote><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="tips"></a>Tips<a class="hash-link" href="#tips" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="drive-without-a-license"></a>Drive without a license<a class="hash-link" href="#drive-without-a-license" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>If you, dear reader, think that not being the most senior / experienced / confident in the context of the current problem means that you won&#x27;t be the driver of a session, you&#x27;re very sadly mistaken. In fact, time permitting, I&#x27;d suggest that the person that fits one or more of those labels should be the last person driving. Embrace your ignorance and drive without a license, and I guarantee you&#x27;ll find yourself learning more during than anyone else during the course of that session. There&#x27;s power in breaking the assumptions that these individuals would have / conduct during the course of that session. You&#x27;ll expose the &#x27;automatism&#x27;s they&#x27;ve learnt / picked up over time and you&#x27;ll find them learning something from you every now and again as well.</p><p>Drive without a license. If someone pulls you over, you (or they) get to understand why and learn something from it.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ask-the-obvious"></a>Ask the obvious<a class="hash-link" href="#ask-the-obvious" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>This is a way to pull out the value of driving while not driving. It&#x27;s far too easy to sit and try to glean as much as possible whilst trying not to interrupt the &quot;flow&quot; of the person currently driving.</p><p>We all know how annoying it can be when someone interrupts you while in the zone, but here&#x27;s the thing: we want to be in the zone together here. That &quot;have you read my mail&quot;, &quot;I just pinged you a message&quot;, &quot;will you be able to make that meeting tomorrow&quot; are so frustrating because of the break from the topic at hand. Here, we&#x27;re all in on the same topic. You&#x27;re not interrupting, you&#x27;re directing past a curb the driver can&#x27;t see, and if you don&#x27;t call out your blind-spots, they will drive right past it, or even worse, straight into a problem your question would have surfaced. </p><p>Live by the adage, &quot;the only stupid question is an un-asked one.&quot;</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="think-with-your-mouth-open"></a>&quot;Think with your mouth open&quot;<a class="hash-link" href="#think-with-your-mouth-open" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>This is the most important tip, and I honestly think this is an incredibly valuable skill.</p><p>People don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re thinking, and if you&#x27;re struggling with something / what you&#x27;re pondering is something that would be valuable for everyone to be considering, thinking quietly robs you and them of an opportunity. The real value here isn&#x27;t in the output (although with practice I think you&#x27;ll be shocked at what you can achieve in a single session).</p><p>What I have noticed as well over the course of the last year and a half of remote working, is that there is less of a barrier to the driver also navigating <em>if the driver is good at showing their working out as they drive.</em></p><p>The magic is in the process. Show your working out. <em>Think with your mouth open.</em></p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="everyone-drives"></a>Everyone drives!<a class="hash-link" href="#everyone-drives" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Pretty self-explanatory. Nobody gets to be a passenger all the time, and no one gets to drive all the time.</p><p>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;d all have a preference for one of the roles outlined. Some people like driving, some people like to be driven. Most people like to navigate (I&#x27;m looking at you in the back-seat) and some like to hang their heads out of the window and bark. Whichever you are, it&#x27;s important to change it up and occupy a different &quot;seat&quot; so to speak, to really get the value out of the exercise.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="tooling"></a>Tooling<a class="hash-link" href="#tooling" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>I&#x27;ve been using <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Share</a> in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code</a> during these monitoring sessions, allowing for myself and others to not just be following what someone is sharing on their screen, but to allow for a real MMORPG style dev experience.

Now, as I&#x27;m sure most of us are aware, it&#x27;s no accident that these adverts are so repetitively placed before each of us. My above-listed hell carousel is the targeted, tailored experience most likely to tempt me based on some (hopefully) wonderfully complex algorithms based on data that&#x27;s been aggregated on me from a number of different areas. A cookie here, a click there, a trend of watched videos (thank you youtube analytics) and you&#x27;re on the road to being type-cast for the rest of your browsing life-time. </p><p>Not sure what I&#x27;m talking about? You sure? You&#x27;ve never had a conversation in your house-hold over a new appliance, remarked it might be time for some new underwear (we all have a pair that can only be described as... tired) or some such innocuous comment, only for the exact topic to be the subject of an ad hours later in a seemingly unrelated area. Creepy, right? Well, while there are a number of ways to try minimise the innate tracking on your web-connected journey through this digital world (potentially another topic to expand on separately) I wanted to try and stop them altogether in my island of connectivity at home, and so:  </p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="along-came-pi-hole"></a>Along came Pi-Hole<a class="hash-link" href="#along-came-pi-hole" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Now that the scene has been set, let&#x27;s find ourselves a solution.

A one-stop shop for all our tracking and ad-blocking needs for the home network. This is just what the imperial &#x27;we&#x27; have been looking for. The next thing we&#x27;ll need is something to run it on and, as the &#x27;Pi&#x27; in &#x27;Pi-Hole&#x27; might suggest, we&#x27;re going to need a Raspberry Pi.

There isn&#x27;t a guaranteed blocking of ads on youtube (unfortunately) as some of the ads served on the platform are served from the same URL that the actual videos on the platform are served from (manifest.googlevideo.com), making blocking them quite difficult.
That being said, there are a few guides on work-arounds out there that I&#x27;ll have a look into and will bring back here. The general browsing experience, however, has been drastically changed. Content comes through much clearer, far less cluttered, and just feels more sanitized.

You see, I&#x27;ve long thought that it would be interesting to do more writing, but found myself lacking that one essential ingredient for the act of writing, and that&#x27;s something worth saying. It&#x27;s a trivial technicality really, as without knowing who other than myself this is for the content should matter very little, but it&#x27;s the excuse I&#x27;ve used, along with the usual suspects of &quot;there isn&#x27;t any time&quot; or &quot;how would this fit into my life&quot; etc, etc. </p><p>That having been said, a colleague of mine recently launched an &quot;intro to blogging&quot; workshop and I find myself inspired to use the practice to share my thoughts with myself and anyone else that may or may not find them interesting.

This may become quite technical in nature, or it could contain purely the meanderings of a wondering mind, exploring their own thoughts in pixels for the sake of.... practice. The purpose behind this is emphatically learning, practice and growth. </p><p>I&#x27;m hoping that blogging will encourage me to do more things interesting to blog about, but would be quite happy if the act of blogging and the practice of putting thought to virtual paper is all I end up doing. This may come down quite quickly and not stick around, may be that thing I do occasionally, or could be a flight of fancy that never really progresses. </p><p>Let&#x27;s see what it shapes into and we&#x27;ll take it from there.</p></div><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/intro">intro</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/blog">blog</a></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Links</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/PlutoSA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122895221-bryan-thomson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Good Reads</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/plutosa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">More</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Feeds</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog/rss.xml">RSS</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog/atom.xml">Atom</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 PlutoSA, Inc.
